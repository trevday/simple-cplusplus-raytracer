# Simple C++ Ray Tracer
This is a quick project I did to familiarize myself with ray tracing concepts as part of a college Graphics course. It serves as a launchpad for more complex projects I did later on, which are linked below. *I would recommend checking those out if you are looking for recent/more interesting projects*. This project is pretty straightforward and small. I used the text [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley as my primary guide, so you'll find the structure very similar to that. There are certainly some inefficiencies where I used to think I was being clever (the template and resulting loops in `Vector.hpp` are not good). This is mostly here to preserve my first attempt at a raytracer.

## Dependencies
Just one, the `stb_image_write` header found [here](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
